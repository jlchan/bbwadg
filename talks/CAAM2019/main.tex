\[
\pd{\bm{u}}{t} + \pd{\bm{f}(\bm{u})}{x} = 0.

\item Continuous entropy inequality: given a convex \note{entropy} function $S(\bm{u})$ and ``entropy potential'' $\psi(\bm{u})$, test with $\bm{v}(\bm{u})$
\begin{align*}
&\int_{\Omega} \bm{v}^T\LRp{\pd{\bm{u}}{t} + \pd{\bm{f}(\bm{u})}{x}} = 0, \qquad \boxed{\bm{v}(\bm{u}) = \pd{S}{\bm{u}}} \\

\[
\bm{Q}_h = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
