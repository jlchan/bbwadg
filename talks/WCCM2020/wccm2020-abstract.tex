High order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods provide improved accuracy and low numerical dispersion/dissipation for simulations of nonlinear conservation laws.  However, these methods also tend to suffer from instability in practice, requiring filtering, limiting, or artificial dissipation to prevent solution blow up.  \textit{Entropy stable} nodal DG methods based on summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and flux differencing address this instability by ensuring satisfaction of a semi-discrete entropy inequality.  Entropy stable DG methods typically utilize Lobatto quadrature points; however, recent work has extended such methods to more general nodal points \cite{esdg1,esdg3}.  In this talk, we will present entropy stable DG methods based on Gauss points, which can improve accuracy on warped and non-conforming meshes \cite{esdg2}.
