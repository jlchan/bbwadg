# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

BBDG is based on the Matlab codes of "Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods" by Jan Hesthaven and Tim Warburton, as well as the MIDG code of Tim Warburton.

BBDG is built with Eigen 3.2.8 (most recent stable version as of Feb 16, 2016). To update Eigen, replace header files in include/Eigen with new header files.

- To compile with nodal basis on MBPr 13 inch: 

   make N=3 B=0 -j

- To compile with Bernstein-Bezier basis:

   make N=3 B=1 -j

To run:

./main meshes/cubeTetra1.msh
