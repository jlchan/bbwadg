% Function: Extraction2D
%
% Input:  n_1 = number of functions in direction 1
%         n_2 = number of functions in direction 2
%         p_1 = polynomial degree in direction 1
%         p_2 = polynomial degree in direction 2
%         Xi_1 = knot vector in direction 1
%         Xi_2 = knot vector in direction 2
%
% Output: n_el = number of 2D elements
%         C_e = array of 2D extraction operators
%
% Purpose: Extract the 2D B-spline basis
%
% Notes: Algorithm follows directly from notes.
